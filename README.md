## ✨ About Me

I'm an AI-Augmented Software Architectr with a background in cybersecurity, now focused on building **accurate, transparent astrology infrastructure** and wellness-adjacent tools that don’t bullshit the math or the people using them.

I care deeply about:
- Correct calculations (no vibes-only astrology)
- Open source, auditable systems
- Trauma-informed, non-coercive design
- Clear separation between computation and interpretation

I work primarily in Python and build systems meant to last.

## 🔭 Current Focus

- 🌌 Astrology APIs & tooling using **Swiss Ephemeris**
- 🧮 Precision-first chart calculations (no approximations)
- 🌿 Integrating somatic & herbal wisdom *without* medical overreach
- 🛠 Low-cost, ethical infrastructure for solo builders

## 🧩 Featured Project

### 🔮 Swiss Ephemeris Astrology API

A lightweight, open-source astrology API built on **Swiss Ephemeris**, designed for accuracy, clarity, and reproducibility.

👉 **Public API & source code:**  
https://github.com/TripleMoonGoddess/swisseph-python-api

**Highlights**
- Uses official Swiss Ephemeris data
- Clean REST API
- Railway-friendly deployment
- Suitable for production or research use
- Built for people who actually care if the math is right

## 🌙 For Astrologers & Practicing Witches

This API was built for astrologers who treat astrology as a **sacred technical art** — not content, not vibes, not entertainment.

It uses **Swiss Ephemeris**, the same astronomical engine trusted by professional astrologers worldwide.  
The calculations are exact. The methods are visible. The lineage is intact.

### What you’re working with

- 🌌 Real ephemeris data (not approximations, not AI guesses)
- 🌒 Planetary positions calculated with precision and care
- 🔍 Transparent logic — no hidden magic, no obscured math
- 🜃 A foundation you can trust for ritual timing, research, and teaching

This is astrology you can **stand on**.

### What this API deliberately refuses to do

- ✖️ No “intuition-based” math  
- ✖️ No black-box chart generation  
- ✖️ No gamified astrology  
- ✖️ No flattening of sacred systems into trend content  

Interpretation belongs to *you*.  
This API handles the **bones of the sky** — not the meaning you draw from them.

### Why this exists

Too many modern astrology tools:
- Cut corners in calculation
- Hide their methods
- Confuse symbolic language with numerical truth

This project exists to honor astrology as both:
- ✨ A divinatory art  
- 🧮 A mathematical discipline  

Precision is part of the magic.

### Ways astrologers use this

- 🜁 Verifying natal charts against trusted sources  
- 🜂 Building personal or professional astrology software  
- 🜄 Teaching astrology without sacrificing technical integrity  
- 🜃 Anchoring intuitive work to accurate celestial timing  

You don’t need to code to recognize good bones.  
You *do* need good bones to do real work.

## 🧪 For Skeptics, Engineers, and People Who Want Receipts

You do not have to believe in astrology to use or evaluate this API.

This project makes **no claims** about meaning, causality, or prediction.  
It makes exactly one claim:

> *These astronomical calculations are accurate and reproducible.*

That’s it.

### What this actually does

- Computes planetary positions using **Swiss Ephemeris**
- Applies well-documented astronomical algorithms
- Returns deterministic numerical results
- Produces the same output given the same input, every time

No interpretation layer is included.  
No symbolic assertions are made.

### What this is *not* asking you to accept

- That planets “cause” behavior  
- That astrology is predictive  
- That symbolism equals science  

If you want to debate astrology, that conversation belongs elsewhere.  
If you want to **verify math**, this repo is happy to have you.

### Why this exists (from a technical standpoint)

Many astrology apps:
- Use approximations for performance
- Obscure calculation details
- Mix interpretation with computation

This API intentionally separates:
- **Astronomy** (measurable, testable)
- **Astrology** (symbolic, interpretive, human)

You can accept one, reject the other, or hold both — the code does not care.

### Valid use cases

- Testing ephemeris accuracy
- Comparing astrology software outputs
- Academic or historical research
- Building neutral tooling without interpretive bias

Skepticism is welcome here.  
Hand-waving is not.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI  
- **Astrology:** Swiss Ephemeris  
- **Infrastructure:** Railway, Docker (when needed)  
- **OS:** macOS  
- **Philosophy:** Explicit > implicit. Accuracy > speed. Clarity > cleverness.

---

## 🌱 Open Source Values

I publish code because:
- Astrology software should be auditable
- People deserve to know how results are calculated
- Open systems keep traditions alive without gatekeeping

If something is unclear, inaccurate, or improvable — open an issue.  
If you want to collaborate, come correct and come curious.
